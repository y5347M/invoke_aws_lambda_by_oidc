# Invoke AWS Lambda by OIDC

This custom GitHub Action allows you to invoke an AWS Lambda function using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication.

## Usage

To use this action in your GitHub workflow, add the following step to your YAML file:

```yaml
- name: Invoke AWS Lambda by OIDC
  uses: y5347M/invoke_aws_lambda_by_oidc@v1.0.1
  with:
    aws-region: 'us-west-2'
    role-to-assume: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole'
    function-name: 'my-lambda-function'
    payload: '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}'
```

## Inputs

- `aws-region`: **(required)** The AWS region to use.
- `role-to-assume`: **(required)** The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume. This role will be used to configure the Actions environment with the assumed role credentials.
- `function-name`: **(required)** The name of the Lambda function to invoke.
- `payload`: **(required)** The payload to send to the Lambda function.

## Outputs

- `lambda-invoke-response`: The result of the Lambda function invocation.
